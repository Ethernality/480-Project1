# 480-Project1

used syntax 'python make_vacuum_world.py 10 10 .2 30 > sample-50x50.txt' to create vacuum maps
used syntax 'python planner.py depth-first sample-50x50.txt' to execute search and move list compilation

Notes:
* had to add utf-16 support for the sample maps txt files since my laptop used that format
